## Quick Tips

- Disable RAG for fast demos:
  - Windows PowerShell: `$env:AIOPS_DISABLE_RAG="true"; python -m aiops.api.main`
  - Linux/macOS: `AIOPS_DISABLE_RAG=true python -m aiops.api.main`

- Prometheus UI: http://localhost:9090 (Targets: `prometheus` and `node` should be UP)
- Mock ServiceNow: http://localhost:8001 (GET `/incidents` to list)
